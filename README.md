# He2Git


##Script Made to scrape all my Hackerearth solutions (close to 1200 at the time of writing)

#Purpose
       Wanted to post all my HackerEarth solutions
       My solutions can be found at https://www.hackerearth.com/users/prashantpandeyfun10/
       to Github . But as I had close to 1200 solutions I thought of automating it and make it a little fun!

#How it is different?
    HackerEarth loads the content dynamically and when you scroll down for 5 times 
    you see a "View More" button which
    when clicked loads more data. So the whole challenge was to automate scrolling 
    and clicking on this "View More"
    button.
    
#Stack used
    I have used Selenium (python api) to do all the scrolling and clicking and have 
    used Firefox driver of Selenium.
    For some reason Chrome was a pain in a** to work with. So YA! choosing and pondering 
    upon the stack prior to jump on coding is one I learnt.
    Was suppose to use PyGithub and gitpython
    but I thought of leaving that for a while as of now.
    
# Help?
    Please feel free to drop me a mail or anything. And please suggest some improvements. 
    Obviously this code may be rubbish for some people and awesome for some people!
